# Screening-TPP-Analysis

This repository provides the relevant code needed to replicate the analyses presented in the paper "Guiding the development of the tuberculosis screening target product profile: evaluating the impact of single/multi-screen approaches at different levels of screening test accuracy".

Five files are available: <br/> 
-High-sensitivity test in a One-screen alorithm: oneTestHighSens.R <br/> 
-High-specificty test in a One-screen alorithm: oneTestHighSpec.R <br/> 
-High-sensitivity test in a Two-screen alorithm: twoTestHighSens.R <br/> 
-High-specificty test in a Two-screen alorithm: twoTestHighSpec.R <br/> 
-Analysis when both sensitivity and specificty are allowed to vary:  unconstrainedAnalysis.R <br/>
